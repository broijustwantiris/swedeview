# swedeview
`swedeview` is a TUI for playing YouTube videos directly from your terminal. It allows you to search for videos, view your watch history, and manage a 'Watch Later' list. It uses `yt-dlp` and `mpv` to handle video data and playback, with background threading to ensure the `curses` UI remains responsive and non-blocking.
